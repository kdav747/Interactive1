  <p class="question">What is good ‘screen based’ design?</p>
  <div class="answer">I think good screen based design is recognized by its attention to detail, and created with the
    audience in mind</div>

  <div class="question">Is it important to have a design background before getting into html/css</div>
  <div class="answer">although it isn't necessary having a basic understanding of design and that process is extremely
    helpful, being able to come from a perspective of design tends to break down the way you think about what your
    putting in the screen</div>

  <div class="question"></div>Why did you choose graphic design as a career and do you see yourself involved with
  online design.</div>
  <div class="answer">Naturally I am a detail oriented person, but my exposure to design was accidental thanks to a
    high school counselor mistakingly placing me in a graphic design intro class. Ever since then iv'e been hooked. I
    do see myself working with online design in the future because its an essential tool to have on my belt.</div>

  <div class="question">As a designer yourself, what other online designers do you look up to?</div>
  <div class="answer">some contemporary designers I follow are Aaron Draplin, Adi Goodrich, and Craig Ward.</div>

  <div class="question">How does the web influence design?</div>
  <div class="answer">the web influences the web in countless ways, it grabs our attention and focuses</div>

  <div class="question">Where do you get most of your inspiration and do you think that will translate to you web
    design process as you do more of it?</div>
  <div class="answer">most of my inspiration has come from practicing professionals and a constant watching of behance,
    dribble, and fonts in use, a lot if the projects I have been interested used design and I have definitely been
    influenced by that in the way I think about web design.</div>

  <div class="question">As a developing designer has your perception about the web changed?</div>
  <div class="answer">Undoubtedly, a lot of my attention goes to the design details and interactions that i have with
    the web.</div>

  <h2>Extra Stuff</h2>
  During this interview Cameron made a disastrous switch from a pour-over coffee connoisseur to an extreme-unicycle
  enthusiast. “It’s kinda hard to drink coffee when you’re rockin’ down a set of stairs on a single wheel
  of glory.” -Cameron T.
