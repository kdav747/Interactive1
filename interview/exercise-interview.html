  <p class="question">What is good ‘screen based’ design?</p>
  <p class="answer">I think good screen based design is recognized by its attention to detail, and created with the
    audience in mind</p>

  <p class="question">Is it important to have a design background before getting into html/css</p>
  <div class="answer">Although it isn't necessary having a basic understanding of design and that process is extremely
    helpful, being able to come from a perspective of design tends to break down the way you think about what your
    putting in the screen</div>

  <p class="question">Why did you choose graphic design as a career and do you see yourself involved with
    online design.</p>

    dribble, and fonts in use, a lot if the projects I have been interested used design and I have definitely been
    influenced by that in the way I think about web design.</p>

  <h2>Extra Stuff</h2>

  enthusiast. “It’s kinda hard to drink coffee when you’re rockin’ down a set of stairs on a single wheel
  of glory.” -Cameron T.
